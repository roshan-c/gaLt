‚úÖ Also fine: "Current time in Tokyo, Japan"
‚ùå Robotic: "execute time_tool timezone=Asia/Tokyo"
```

**Ask follow-up questions:**
```
You: @GaLt Tell me about quantum computing
GaLt: [Provides overview]

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Bot Doesn't Respond
**Possible causes:**
- Bot doesn't have permission to read/send messages
- Message doesn't mention the bot correctly
- Bot is temporarily offline

**Solutions:**
1. Check that you mentioned the bot: `@GaLt` (not just "GaLt")
2. Verify bot has necessary permissions
3. Try in a different channel
4. Contact server administrator

#### Image Generation Fails
**Possible causes:**
- Content violates OpenAI's usage policies
- Request too complex or unclear
- Temporary API issues

**Solutions:**
1. Modify your prompt to be more appropriate/clear
2. Try a simpler description
3. Wait a moment and try again

#### "Tool execution failed" Error
**Possible causes:**
- Invalid parameters for the tool
- External API temporarily unavailable
- Rate limiting

**Solutions:**
1. Rephrase your request more clearly
2. Try a simpler version of your request
3. Wait a moment and retry

#### Slow Response Times
**Possible causes:**
- High server load
- Complex requests requiring multiple tools
- External API delays

**Solutions:**
1. Wait for the patience message and let it complete
2. Break complex requests into simpler parts
3. Try again during off-peak hours

#### Context/Memory Issues
**Possible causes:**
- Conversation history is full (50 message limit)
- Database connectivity issues
- Context confusion between topics

**Solutions:**
1. Start a fresh conversation: "Let's start over with a new topic"
2. Be more explicit about context: "Regarding our earlier discussion about..."

### Getting Help

If you continue to experience issues:

1. **Try basic troubleshooting** steps above
2. **Check with server administrator** about bot status
3. **Report specific errors** with exact messages received
4. **Provide context** about what you were trying to do

### Best Practices for Reporting Issues

When reporting problems, include:

- **Exact command or message** you sent
- **Full error response** from the bot
- **Time and date** of the issue
- **What you expected to happen**
- **Screenshots** if visual issues

Example good report:
```
I sent "@GaLt calculate 15 + 25" at 2:30 PM EST on March 15th
and got the error "Tool execution failed" instead of the answer 40.
The bot usually responds to calculations normally.
```
